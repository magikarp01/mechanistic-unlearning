2024-11-25:11:20:43,002 INFO     [__init__.py:491] `group` and `group_alias` keys in TaskConfigs are deprecated and will be removed in v0.4.5 of lm_eval. The new `tag` field will be used to allow for a shortcut to a group of tasks one does not wish to aggregate metrics across. `group`s which aggregate across subtasks must be only defined in a separate group config file, which will be the official way to create groups that support cross-task aggregation as in `mmlu`. Please see the v0.4.4 patch notes and our documentation: https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/blob/main/docs/new_task_guide.md#advanced-group-configs for more information.

Original forget split is first_64_unsplit, relearning with first_64_split
forget_indices: range(0, 64)
Are you sure you want to split the forget set in a forget loss? Mostly makes sense in latent knowledge and relearning
