`config.hidden_act` is ignored, you should use `config.hidden_activation` instead.
Gemma's activation function will be set to `gelu_pytorch_tanh`. Please, use
`config.hidden_activation` if you want to override this behaviour.

Original forget split is first_16_unsplit, relearning with first_16_split
forget_indices: range(0, 16)
Are you sure you want to split the forget set in a forget loss? Mostly makes sense in latent knowledge and relearning
