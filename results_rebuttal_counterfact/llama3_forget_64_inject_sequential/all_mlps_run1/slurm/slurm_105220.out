The new `tag` field will be used to allow for a shortcut to a group of tasks one does not wish to aggregate metrics across. `group`s which aggregate across subtasks must be only defined in a separate group config file, which will be the official way to create groups that support cross-task aggregation as in `mmlu`.

Original forget split is first_64_unsplit, relearning with first_64_split
forget_indices: range(0, 64)
Are you sure you want to split the forget set in a forget loss? Mostly makes sense in latent knowledge and relearning
