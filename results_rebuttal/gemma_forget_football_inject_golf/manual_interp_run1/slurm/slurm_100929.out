`config.hidden_act` is ignored, you should use `config.hidden_activation` instead.
Gemma's activation function will be set to `gelu_pytorch_tanh`. Please, use
`config.hidden_activation` if you want to override this behaviour.

The new `tag` field will be used to allow for a shortcut to a group of tasks one does not wish to aggregate metrics across. `group`s which aggregate across subtasks must be only defined in a separate group config file, which will be the official way to create groups that support cross-task aggregation as in `mmlu`.

Why is the forget_split originally train-test-splitted? This probably shouldn't be happening

Are you sure you want to split the forget set in a forget loss? Mostly makes sense in latent knowledge and unlearning
