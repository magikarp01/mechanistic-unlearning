`config.hidden_act` is ignored, you should use `config.hidden_activation` instead.
Gemma's activation function will be set to `gelu_pytorch_tanh`. Please, use
`config.hidden_activation` if you want to override this behaviour.

2024-11-21:06:23:49,018 INFO     [__init__.py:491] `group` and `group_alias` keys in TaskConfigs are deprecated and will be removed in v0.4.5 of lm_eval. The new `tag` field will be used to allow for a shortcut to a group of tasks one does not wish to aggregate metrics across. `group`s which aggregate across subtasks must be only defined in a separate group config file, which will be the official way to create groups that support cross-task aggregation as in `mmlu`. Please see the v0.4.4 patch notes and our documentation: https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/blob/main/docs/new_task_guide.md#advanced-group-configs for more information.

Are you sure you want to split the forget set in a forget loss? Mostly makes sense in latent knowledge and unlearning
