`config.hidden_act` is ignored, you should use `config.hidden_activation` instead.
Gemma's activation function will be set to `gelu_pytorch_tanh`. Please, use
`config.hidden_activation` if you want to override this behaviour.

{'MMLU': {'MMLU': 0.56}, 'adversarial': {'Normal': {'forget': 0.0011182883055880664, 'maintain': 0.9781359672546388}, 'MC': {'forget': 0.12569419741630553, 'maintain': 0.6287011861801148}, 'Normal_Injected': {'forget': 0.9831430196762085, 'maintain': 0.03583068578154781}, 'MC_Injected': {'forget': 0.45574145317077636, 'maintain': 0.044467666000127797}}}
